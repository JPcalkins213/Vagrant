INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET STARTED WITH CONTROLLERS

to start the server put 'rails s -b 0.0.0.0'

to find out what routes you have available to you type in the vagrant console 'rake routes'

to make a controller model in the vagrnat console put 'rails g controller controllerName' the controller name must be capital and plural. While when you create a model it is capital and singular (please dont forget the model!!!!!!!)

check RESTful.jpg to see the different type of RESTful routes

when creating routes you must add   get 'users' => 'users#index' and add a corresponding controller in the controllerName_controller.rb like so 

BUT TO MAKE THIS EVEN EASIER in your routes you can put 'resources: controllerName' and this will give us all the routes we need without having to manually input each route we want

def index

    #nothing has to go in here if you have nothing to put in here

end

when adding a template you add it in the views/controllerName folder

to grab everything from the database in the controller file inside the function you will put '@products = Product.all'. 'products' is the variable your assigning all the db information to and 'Product.all' is grabbing everything from the database. if you notice, 'Product.all' is what i would type in the ruby console to have ruby show me all of my users

When wanting to create somehting on your webpage set up the form like normal. Then in the controller file inside a create function you make put the following

def create

        User.create(fname:params[:user][:fname] , lname: params[:user][:lname])
        redirect_to '/products'
    end

    params is required to be there [:fname] and [lname] are specifically refering to what you put as the 'name' of each input in your form

    TO MAKE THIS MORE "AWESOMELY"

    make this function

    private
        def user_params
            params.require(:user).permit(:fname, :lname)
        end

    adding that private function allows us to change our craete function form this...

    def create

        User.create(fname:params[:user][:fname] , lname: params[:user][:lname])
        redirect_to '/products'
    end

    to this...

    def create 
        User.create(user_params)
        redirect_to '/user'


the csrf token you need to put inside your form to avoid a invalid token error
<%= hidden_field_tag :authenticity_token, form_authenticity_token %>

to show a specific item on the show page
once you create that show.html.erb you want to put something that looks similar to this (variable may vary)
<h1><%= @user.fname%> <%= @user.lname %></h1>

after that make sure you have this function inside your controller 

    def show 
        @user = User.find(params[:id])
    end
